// Petya and Vasya love participating in Codeforces contests. Vasya made a bet with Petya that he will take part in more rated rounds than him. Initially, Vasya's rating is R0
// . There will be n
//  rounds conducted in total, each of one of two types:

// div. 1 — rated for all participants
// div. 2 — rated for participants with rating strictly less than X
// , and unrated for all others,
// In an unrated round, Vasya cannot change his rating. If Vasya's rating before a rated round was R
// , then for any non-negative integer x
//  between R−D
//  and R+D
//  (inclusive) Vasya can adopt a strategy such that his rating becomes exactly x
//  afterwards (here D
//  is a positive integer). Note that rating may never become negative.

// Help Vasya determine the maximum number of rated rounds he can participate in.

// Input
// Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
//  (1≤t≤1000
// ). The description of the test cases follows.

// The first line of each test case contains four integers: R0,X,D,n
//  (0≤R0≤109
// , 1≤X≤109
// , 1≤D,n≤1000
// ) — Vasya's initial rating, the rating threshold between divisions, the maximum rating delta, and the number of rounds.

// The second line of each test case contains a string of size n
// . The string will only contain the characters "1" and "2", representing div. 1 and div. 2 rounds respectively.

// The sum of n
//  across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅104
// .

// Output
// For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of rated rounds Vasya can participate in.

// Example
// Input
// 4
// 2100 2100 5 3
// 222
// 2098 2100 5 6
// 111211
// 2115 2100 226 7
// 2211121
// 0 10 4 8
// 22111121
// Output
// 0
// 6
// 5
// 8
// Note
// In the first example, since R0≥X
// , each div. 2 round is unrated for Vasya, so his rating never changes. Therefore, he cannot make any round rated for himself, and the answer is 0

// In the second example, one of the optimal sequences of ratings after each round is: 2098→2103→2101→2099→2097→2092
